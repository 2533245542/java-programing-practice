Program 1. 容积计算器：用户输入一张铝箔的长和宽，程序计算并输出这个铝箔所围成最大体积圆柱体的直径和高。<br>
Program 1. Container Calculator: The program is to calculate the volume and surface area of a cylinder based on the input diameter and height. It would also validate if the input is greater than zero and smaller than 2,147,483,648. Based on the input, it would also output a diameter and height that makes the surface area as small as possible while maintaining a high volume. Still, based on the input, it would calculate the diameter and height that make the contain have a lowest aluminum paint weight while maintaining a high volume.<br><br><br>
Program 2. 细胞生存模拟：在游戏开始前，用户可以选择预设的细胞排列或者自己创造排列。游戏开始后，用户每一次按下回车，程序会根据规则决定每一个细胞的生存，死亡或复活，并且显示存活细胞的数量。<br>
Program 2. Game of Life: The program allows the user to play the game Game of Life. The following
patterns can be selected: Glider, Beacon, Beehive, P-pentomino, and Random. The player can also costumize the pattern. The player can choose to see different generations of cell pattern by pressing enter. The player can enter "end" to exit the pattern. The player can then enter "7" to exit the game.<br><br><br>
Program 3. 星际穿梭： 用户需要操纵宇宙飞船按顺序访问不同星球。飞船只有极少的燃料且速度极慢，所以用户需要通过点击黑洞来利用引力移动。在利用黑洞引力行驶时，点击任意一个方向键会使飞船停止。如果飞船在访问星球时用的是引力速度，飞船则会爆炸，游戏结束；如果飞船燃料用尽，游戏也会结束。每次访问完当前难度所有星球后，游戏进入下一关。<br>
*星际穿梭: 在运行程序之前, 需将 “WarpStarTaxi.jar”（在program3文件夹内） "add to path"*<br>  
Program 3. Warp Star Taxi: The user operates a taxi to visit different planetsa. The taxi has a very limited amount fuel and speed so in most of the time, the taxi will be moved by user clicking warp stars to let the taxi move in a certain direction at the warp speed. When the taxi is traveling at wrap speed, the taxi can be stopped by user pressing W, A, S or D. If taxi is traveling at warp speed when visiting planets, the taxi crashes, and the game ends; if taxi runs out of fuel, the game also ends. The game will proceed to the next level when all planets in the current level are succesfully visited. <br>
*Warp Star Taxi: Before program3 runs, one should do "add to path" for "WarpStarTaxi.jar"(in Program 3 folder)*
